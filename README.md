# HorseRaceSimulator

Introduction:
This Horse Race Simulator project simulates a horse race. It provides a GUI which offers the ability to customise the horses and the race tracks. Some of these customisation options include naming the horse, giving the player(S) the option to choose a specific character to represent their horse, as well as allowing a range of 2-5 horses to compete. The GUI has been developed using Java Swing.

Installation + how to run:
- Download all of the Java files
- If using an IDE, run and a GUI should open up
- If using the CLI, place all java files in the desired directory. Then open CLI and navigate to that directory, then run "javac *.java"
