# HorseRaceSimulator

Introduction:
This Horse Race Simulator project simulates a horse race. It provides a GUI which offers the ability to customise the horses and the race tracks. Some of these customisation options include naming the horse, giving the player(S) the option to choose a specific character to represent their horse, as well as allowing a range of 2-5 horses to compete. The GUI has been developed using Java Swing.

Installation + how to run:
- Download all of the Java files
- Place these files in a new folder
- Using the Command Line Interface, navigate to the directory containing the files
- Use the following command to compile the files: javac *.java
- Then use "java RaceCustomisation.java"
Note: a JFrame will appear in which you can customise the race and the horses although you need to move the slider representing the number of horses in order for some of the panels to appear.
